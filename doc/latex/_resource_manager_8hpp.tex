The resource manager is implemented in a singleton, with its constructor, de-\/constructor and assigning operation hidden from outer access. ~\newline
 User calls different get methods to inquire for a certain resource. Before allocating memory, the resource manager will search corresponding map to verify its existence. If it has been cached before, the manager will directly return the pointer from the map instead of allocating new spaces. This implement ensures that for specific resource there is only one copy in the memory. ~\newline
 At present the resource manager only supports images, texts, and musics. By it can be easily extended by adding extra map and implementing get methods needed. ~\newline
