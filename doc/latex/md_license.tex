Our licensing terms are simple\+:

You may use the sound effects you download in your films, videos, multimedia projects, presentations, apps, games and just about any other project -\/ but you are not allowed to sell, license, distribute or post online the sound effects on their own, in any form as standalone sound effects (audio, video or data), even if you modify them.

The sound effects meant to be incorporated into your projects. They are not meant to be distributed in any way as sound effects or ringtones -\/ or to be used in sound related apps (such as \char`\"{}funny sounds app\char`\"{}). This should be common sense.

Youtube Users\+: While you may use our sounds in your videos, you may not post our sounds as \char`\"{}sound effect videos\char`\"{} to any website. An example would be a video titled \char`\"{}mosquito sound effect\char`\"{} that just plays our mosquito sound.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us at\+:
